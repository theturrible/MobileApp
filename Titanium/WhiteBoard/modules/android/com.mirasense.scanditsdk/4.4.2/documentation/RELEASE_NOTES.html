<h3>Android</h3>

<ul>
<li>Software update to address issues when two barcode pickers were instantiated within the same app. With the new camera control in 4.3.0, the lifecycle of the two ScanditSDKListeners was not clearly defined so that the wrong of the two pickers could receive scan results via the callbacks.

<h1>Scandit SDK 4.1 for Android (Aug 1st, 2014)</h1>

<h2>New features/Better scan performance:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Codabar Support: Scandit 4.1 supports the decoding of Codabar barcodes in sharp images.
Codabar is disabled by default and needs to be enabled by calling picker.setCodabarEnabled(true).</p></li>
<li><p>Code93 Support: Scandit 4.1 support the decoding of Code93 barcodes in sharp and blurry images.
The new implementation also supports the Full Ascii Mode of Code 93. Code93 is disabled by default
and needs to be enabled by calling picker.setCode93Enabled(true).</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-Scan Support (still BETA): Scandit 4.1 supports the decoding of multiple barcodes within the same
camera frame. This mode is recommended for applications where multiple barcodes are present on the
same label. Note: This multi-scan API is still in BETA and might evolve in future versions.
To support multi-scan, the Scandit API features a new configuration interface. Contact us at <br />
info@scandit.com if you want to start using this feature. </p></li>
<li><p>Tap to Focus: Novel Autofocus strategy to reduce time to sharp image, to prevent repetitive autofocus 
attempts and to allow user to trigger autofocus by tapping the screen. </p></li>
<li><p>Added possibility to change the viewfinder line width and corner radius in the scan view.</p></li>
<li><p>Better performance in challenging lighting conditions (shadows/glare): Improved scanning performance 
with shadows across barcode, glare in the camera image or low contrast barcodes (printed on coloured 
backgrounds).</p></li>
<li><p>Better performance with round barcodes: Scandit SDK 4.1 improves the dynamic range in which round 
barcodes are decoded significantly. </p></li>
<li><p>Blurry ITF (2 of 5) Support: Scandit 4.1 supports the decoding of blurry ITF barcodes.
Previous versions only decoded sharp ITF (2 of 5) barcodes. </p></li>
<li><p>Improved Datamatrix decoding: The Datamatrix decoder provides better scan performance with low contrast <br />
and colored Datamatrix codes.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved QR decoding via force2dRecognition API method</p></li>
<li><p>Enabled decoding of single digit Code128 barcodes.</p></li>
<li><p>Quiet zone violations: The Scandit barcode scanner is now less restrictive when barcodes are scanned
that are printed with quiet zone violations.</p></li>
<li><p>Better Vuzix M100 digital eyewear support: The Autofocus/Exposure trigger algorithms have been adjusted 
for the Vuzix M100 to trigger the exposure adjustment more quickly. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes/Software Updates in 4.1.1 (Aug 15th, 2014)  (Android only)</h2>

<h3>Android</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fixed bug that prevented QR decoding on Google Glass.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes/Software Updates in 4.1.0 (Aug 1st, 2014)</h2>

<h3>All SDKs</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed bug that could lead to Scandit SDK crash in landscape mode when restrictedAreaScanning was <br />
activated.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug in ITF decoder where some thin/wide barcode bar ratios were not supported.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Scandit SDK 4.0 for Android</h1>

<p>New features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Full screen scanning:  In this new release, barcodes are detected and decoded in
the entire camera image. In Scandit SDK 3.* releases , barcodes were only decoded in the
center of the camera image. There is a new API method to restrict the active scanning area.</p></li>
<li><p>Faster and more reliable blurry barcode scan decoding for all retail codes (UPC, EAN13, EAN8 and UPC-E).</p></li>
<li><p>Blurry Code39/Code128 decoding: with Scandit SDK 4.0.*, we are now also making our unique blurry barcode decoding approach available for Code39 and Code 128 barcodes. This makes barcode scanning faster (no need to wait for autofocus) and enables the scanning of these industrial codes on low end devices without autofocus. We recommend that you switch off symbologies that your application does not process to optimize scanning performance.</p></li>
<li><p>PDF417 Support: We added support for PDf417 decoding. The new PDf417 decoder is capable of
decoding PDF417 barcodes with tiny features such as those PDF417 codes found on US driving licenses. The PDF417 decoder is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><p>Google Glass Support: We improved the barcode scan performance for Google Glass. The Scandit SDK 4.0.0 version can decode UPC/EAN barcodes of normal size up to 50 cm away from the Google glass. On Google Glass, the Scandit SDK is configured to only scan barcodes in the center of the image.</p></li>
<li><p>Separate slices for armv5, armv7 and x86 cpu architectures for faster scanning: Scandit SDK 4.0.0 (beta) introduces separate slices for armv5, armv7 and x86 Android devices.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Important Changes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(Android) Scandit SDK 4.0.0 for Android no longer supports Android 2.1 and 2.2 devices. Devices with these OS versions have little market share (&lt; 1.2% according to https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html) and the Android NDK is no longer maintained/updated for these devices. If you require Android 2.1 and 2.2 support, we recommend that you continue to use Scandit SDK 3.5.* for Android.</p></li>
<li><p>Decoding Code128 and Code 39 barcodes results in a slightly larger overhead since we introduced the scanning of blurry barcodes for these two symbologies. We recommend that you switch off symbologies that your application does not process to optimize the overall scanning performance.</p></li>
<li><p>(Android) Make sure that you copy the resources from the res/raw folder into your project to replace the old Scandit resources. The folder contains updated icons that are required by the scan user interface.</p></li>
